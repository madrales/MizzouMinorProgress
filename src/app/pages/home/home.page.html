        <h5 class="subtext">
          To obtain the full benefits of our website, we recommend visiting  our calculators once a semester. Simply input what courses you have completed up to the current point in time from the drop down. Once you submit those courses, you will be presented with your percentage towards completion as well as what core courses and electives you are left to complete. You can then use that information to elect courses to enroll in.

        <h5 class="subtext">
          From Application Development to CyberSecurity, the College of Engineering offers a plethora of undergrad certificate options. Certificates provide students with valuable documentation of their learning as well as increased felxbility when compared to major and minor programs.

        <h1 class="notoSerif titleText">Which option is best for me? Minor or Certificate?</h1>
        <h5 class="subtext">
          Minor programs allow students to incorporate optional coursework into their academic program in order to graduate with the official minor attached to their degree. Certificates on the other hand, are less prominent versions of a minor that can still show the student's coursework.

      <h5 class="subtext">
        The degree auditor is still available for students to track their progress. This application was created with the intent of allowing students to see how close they are to completing each minor and/or certificate within the College of Engineering, even if they have no previous knowledge of these programs.
