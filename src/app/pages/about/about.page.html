          This website was created for the Information Technology Capstone course. Our team was tasked by Brian Maurer to create an application that would assist student’s in their pursuit towards certificates and minors within the University of Missouri’s College of Engineering. Our project was created with the intention of future growth, so that additional minors and certificates encompassed by the College of Engineering may be added. We would like to add special thanks to Brian Maurer, Chip Gubera, Fang Wang and Nickolas Wergeles for the support they provided our team in the production of this website.

      <!--           Starting up with our project the website that you're looking at now wasn't our first idea.  Five weeks into the course we were forced to give up on our first project due to some conflicts of interest.  Because of this we were forced to restart and find a new project idea however our mentor came to the rescue and presented to us the idea for a Minor/Certificate Calculator.  From there we met with the instructor of the course and was given the green light to start working on our new project.  We then spent the next five weeks developing and testing a prototype for our site.  At the end of our fifth week of developing we were expected to present what we had so far to the faculty in the IT Department.  That brought a challenge of it's own, we were met with a lot of harsh feedback on the way the students would be entering their courses for the calculator.  The orginal form that we had for testing had the user type in each course number individually.  We had stated in the presentation that it was in no way our final form and that we were going to go back and change it later down the line.  After the harsh feedback Sarina immediatley went in and created a dropdown menu so that the student could select multiple classes at a time without needing to type anything in.  It was thanks to this harsh feedback that we were able to bunker down and get everything done that we needed to by the deadline and in turn made us better developers. -->
